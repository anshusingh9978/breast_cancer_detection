# breast_cancer_detection
This project is a Breast Cancer Detection System built using Machine Learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. It predicts whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on patient data like mean radius, texture, smoothness, etc.
